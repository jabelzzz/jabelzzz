# Hi there! I'm Jabel 👋

I'm a passionate **Sysadmin** and **Junior Python Developer** eager to learn and build cool things. I love solving problems, automating tasks, and seeing how technology can simplify daily life.

### ⚙️ My Sysadmin Side

As a Sysadmin, I'm the "architect" and "gardener" of systems. I ensure everything runs smoothly, like an **orchestra conductor** coordinating all instruments so the music sounds perfect.

*   **Server Management:** Linux & Windows are my Code Playground.
*   **Networking:** Understanding how systems communicate.
*   **Monitoring:** Keeping an eye on the health of the infrastructure.
*   **Security:** Protecting systems from potential threats.

I love optimizing, debugging, and maintaining stable environments.

### 🐍 My Python World

As a Python developer, I appreciate the language's versatility. I see it as a **digital Swiss Army knife**:

*   **Automation:** From simple scripts for repetitive tasks to more complex workflows.
*   **Backend Development:** Exploring frameworks and building APIs.
*   **Data Analysis:** I enjoy extracting valuable insights from data.

My projects often focus on making life easier, whether for myself or for others.

### 💡 My Philosophy (with a touch of analogy)

I like to think of programming and system administration as building with **LEGO bricks**:

*   **Python:** These are the **variously colored bricks** I can use to build almost anything, from a house to a robot.
*   **Sysadmin:** This is the **instruction manual and the maintenance of the play area**, ensuring the bricks are organized, the floor is clean, and the constructions are stable.

I'm always looking for new bricks and better ways to build.
